# Abstract

## What `ping -n 15 127.0.0.1 > nul` does?
On Windows, it's hard to implemnet reliable `sleep` command to wait for certain amount of time. What this command does, is perform `n` pings - in the example it's 15 - one every each second and does not print the output. So in essence, it's equal to `wait n seconds`. It is done to let all the docekr images and services time to boot up.
